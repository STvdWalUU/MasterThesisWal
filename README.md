# SA-ILP

This repository contains three folders. All code was used for the writing of a Master's Thesis. It is either downloaded open source and edited or created by the publisher.

The folder 'SA-ILP' contains code for the SA-ILP algorithm created by Sam Hesselmans (2022) and edited to solve the SVRPTW using a KDE approximation to arrival times distributions. Only the parts that were edited and/or used by the KDE version of the algorithm are commented by me (S.T. van der Wal). The rest is from S. Hesselmans. See his repository for more information via https://github.com/samhesselmans/SA-ILP.

The folder 'Instances' contains the instances that are were used in the thesis and contains code to compute edited instances and the code to obtain the sample data for the KDE method.
