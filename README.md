# SA-ILP
 
This reposity contains the code for the SA-ILP algorithm created for the VRPLTT model as introduced by Fontaine https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221721007682. This is version of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows.

This code was created as a research project and therefore, is only sparingly commented and some code might be rather bloated. Executing the full multithreaded version of the algorithm requires an active Gurobi license on the machine. Some examples on how to use the code can be found in Program.cs, where the launch parameters are checked.

This repository also contains the created Utrecht vrpltt instance
